# Waves localization in thin elastic structures

Elastic waves can form robust bound states in thin elastic structures
with spatially varying curvature profiles.  This repository provides
a couple of Python scripts and Mathematica notebooks that are useful to
demonstrate wave localization in these structures.

## Usage

The scripts in this repository require the standard Python
scientific stack ([NumPy][numpy] + [SciPy][scipy]) and
[Dedalus][dedalus].  Plotting requires [Matplotlib][mpl],
[charu][charu], and [wolframclient][wc].
