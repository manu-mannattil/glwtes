[![arXiv](https://shields.io/badge/arXiv-2306.07213-b31b1b)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07213)

## Usage

The scripts in this repository require the standard Python
scientific stack ([NumPy][numpy] + [SciPy][scipy]) and
[Dedalus][dedalus].  Plotting requires [Matplotlib][mpl],
[charu][charu], and [wolframclient][wc].

## Description

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manu-mannattil/assets/master/glwtes/repo.svg"/>

Elastic waves can form robust bound states in thin elastic structures
with spatially varying curvature profiles.  The bound states are formed
around points where the absolute curvature of the structure has
a minimum.  This repository provides a couple of Python scripts and
Mathematica notebooks that are useful to demonstrate wave localization
in thin rods and singly-curved shells.
